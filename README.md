# The-Gauntlet-
Only theories that walk the paradox crucible survive 
# 🔮 The Physics Paradox Engine

**Welcome to the Crystal Maze for your physics theories.** 
If you dare to enter, your work will be stress-tested against paradoxes, contradictions, and evidence gaps. 
No bias, no mercy — just logic, math, and consistency checks.

## 🚀 What is this?

The **Paradox Engine** is a meta-review tool. 
Feed it your theory text + equations, and it will:

- Identify **claims** 
- Demand your **math and evidence** 
- Test for **internal contradictions** 
- Flag **counterpoints and paradoxes** you didn’t resolve 
- Score your **evidence quality** 

If your theory survives, it earns bragging rights. 
If it fails… at least you get the breadcrumbs back.

## 🧩 How to Use

1. Fork or clone this repo 
2. Put your theory text into a `.txt` file (claims, equations, evidence) 
3. Run the paradox engine on it (see `examples/`) 
4. Collect your JSON verdict and cry/celebrate accordingly

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This repo isn’t peer review. 
It’s harsher. 
The engine can’t be lied to, and it doesn’t care about reputations. 
If your theory passes here, it means it’s paradox-tight. If it fails, well… join the club.
