CLAIM 1: Dark matter is real and required for galaxies
========================================================

Equation (rotation curve prediction, ΛCDM):
v(r) = √(GM(r)/r)

Expectation:
Observed v(r) should match baryonic mass predictions.

Evidence provided:
- Galaxy rotation curves (e.g. Rubin 1970s)
- ΛCDM explains flat curves by adding 85% non-luminous matter

Counterpoints:
- No direct detection of dark matter particles
- Alternative fits (e.g. MBT, MOND) reproduce curves without unseen mass
- JWST early galaxy formation undermines ΛCDM scaling

========================================================
CLAIM 2: Dark energy is real and drives cosmic acceleration
========================================================

Equation (Friedmann with Λ):
H² = (8πG/3)ρ - kc²/a² + Λc²/3

Expectation:
Pantheon+ supernovae fit requires Λ > 0

Evidence provided:
- Pantheon+ dataset (SN Ia luminosity distances)

Counterpoints:
- JWST discovery of mature galaxies at z > 10 breaks ΛCDM timelines
- Pantheon+ fits increasingly inconsistent without parameter tweaking
- No physical mechanism for Λ, only a fitted constant

========================================================
CLAIM 3: ΛCDM fully explains observed cosmology
========================================================

Evidence provided:
- CMB anisotropies
- BAO peaks
- Large-scale structure growth

Counterpoints:
- Hubble tension (local H₀ vs early H₀) unresolved
- Cold spot anomaly unexplained
- Structure growth too fast under ΛCDM
